# UVR-Flight-Dynamics-Platform

Inspired by RASAero, OpenRocket, AeroLab, and ASTOS, this application will conduct the majority of Flight Dynamics' calculations and present the analysis in a concise and easy to use format.


### Features:
 - Provide maximum altitude for input variables
 - Given a range of value, show how varying each parameter would affect the flight profile
 - Analyze the mechanics of a supersonic flight
 - Display information in an easy to understand GUI
 - Calculate stability for the rocket
 - Size motors given a list of possibilities
 - Provide documentation facilitating an understanding of the underlying mechanics of the project
